# Crop_Yield_Prediction_Project

## Introduction
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the yield of various crops. The model takes into account factors such as location, weather conditions, and other relevant parameters to provide an accurate yield forecast.


 **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Crop_Yield_Prediction_Project.git
   cd Crop_Yield_Prediction_Project

**Model Training:**
   ---bash
   The model training process involves:
   
   Loading and preprocessing the data
   Splitting the data into training and testing sets
   Training various machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
   Evaluating the models and selecting the best one based on performance metrics

**Evaluation:**
   ---bash
   The model is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and R-squared score to assess its accuracy and reliability.

**Results:**
   ---bash
   The results section will include the performance metrics of the trained model on the test set, along with visualizations such as feature importance and prediction vs actual yield plots.
